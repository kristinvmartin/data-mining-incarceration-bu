# data-mining-incarceration-bu

These are project files for CS 699 - Data Mining at Boston University, in which I tested and trained various models to determine the best fit for a given dataset. This project sought to identify certain cultural, economic, and demographic factors that contribute to crime and incarceration rates.  .arff and .model files are run from Weka.

The full project submission file is in the .docx file in the repository.

# Knowledge Gained & Observations Made

The project scope allowed me to gain a real-life understanding of the applications of data mining.  I appreciated the topic chosen because it was a very accessible and very impactful application for data mining.  Coming from an undergraduate degree in political science with a focus on human rights, I have researched crime and incarceration, including the contributing economic, social, and cultural factors that drive some people to crime.  Seeing a larger data set that provided support for many of the factors that “make sense” (like poverty), and provided new insight into factors that might be less intuitive for a political scientist (like the percentage of children whose parents aren’t married) was very fascinating.

On the technical side, I enjoyed getting the hands-on experience of testing multiple models to find the best one.  I found it incredibly tedious to test 40 models, however, and I wonder if data miners are building such an extensive set of models when they are trying to select a model, or if their expertise can help them “whittle down” which models may fit best and simply test a few.  I also found it quite interesting to see such a different test result from the algorithms using J48, bagging with J48, and AdaBoostM1 with J48, for instance.  Using bagging and boosting sometimes greatly changed the model’s accuracy, and with J48, the interpretability of the results was greatly reduced (when faced with so many decision trees it was difficult to glean meaningful insights from anywhere but the summary section).

Finally, although I found the extensive model creation to be quite tedious and potentially excessive, I am glad to have gone through the process of creating different models and comparing them using different performance measures to find the best model for the dataset.
